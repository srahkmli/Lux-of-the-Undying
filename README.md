**Plot Overview:**

In the twilight realm between life and death, an Undead soul named **Volaris** finds himself trapped. His mortal coil has been severed, and yet, he cannot pass into the afterlife. His soul is bound by a mysterious force—a **cursed lux**—an ethereal glow that signifies the last remnants of his mortal essence. The lux is both a blessing and a curse. It keeps him tethered to the physical world, but at a cost: it prevents his soul from finding peace, leaving him in an endless limbo. 

Desperate to escape this torment, Volaris learns of a **reclusive magician**, **Azraen**, whose dark magic might have the power to sever the tie between him and the lux. However, the cost of this severance is not what Volaris expects. Should he lose the lux, it will disappear from the world forever, and his soul will be lost, irreversibly vanishing from existence.

To complicate matters further, there are dark forces at play. **Evil spirits**, driven by malice and hunger for the lux’s power, relentlessly hunt him, seeking to steal it and use its energy for their own nefarious purposes. The spirits are drawn to the lux like moths to a flame, and if they succeed in taking it, Volaris will be doomed to wander the Earth as a forgotten, nameless soul.

**Key Gameplay Mechanics:**

1. **Lux Protection:** The primary challenge of the game is protecting the lux while navigating treacherous environments. Players must defend it from ever-encroaching evil spirits by using strategic combat, magic, and environmental interaction. The lux is both a physical object and a beacon that attracts enemies, so players must balance offense and defense.

2. **Moral Choices:** As Volaris journeys through the world, players are presented with difficult moral decisions. Should he risk losing the lux to gain peace, or does he protect it at all costs, knowing it will make him a target for darker forces?

3. **Spirit Encounters:** Evil spirits come in various forms, each with unique abilities. Some can drain Volaris’s life force, while others can manipulate time or reality. Players will need to adapt to the different types of spirits in order to survive.

4. **Magical Powers:** Along the way, Volaris can discover magical artifacts that allow him to temporarily shield the lux or even manipulate it to ward off the spirits. However, these powers are finite and must be used strategically.

5. **The Magician’s Help:** Players will eventually find the magician Azraen, who offers guidance, but also tests Volaris’s resolve. Azraen’s true intentions remain unclear, and his offer to sever the tie between Volaris and the lux could lead to an unexpected ending.
